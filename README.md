Stats 418 Final Project on Predicting NBA Props

Goal: Predict NBA player statistics for a particular game against a chosen opponent, to
be used as a resource for sports gamblers
● Build an Rshiny app that predicts player props (points, rebs, assists, 3pm, etc.)
given team and opposing team statistics
● Drop down menus of players, statistics, and opponents
● Use scraper to get player statistics (Image 1 below)  and team rankings (Image 2

● Scrape odds of real games to compare similarity to "true odds" from sportsbooks
● Separate tab within RShiny that shows historical visuals of shot charts and recent
performance trend graphs
